/**
 * Factors are one of the basic elements of quality models. A factor constitutes
 * a property of the software product (or a part of it) that is related to the
 * productâ€™s quality. A factor is always defined in a way, that it is possible
 * to talk about the degree to which it is present in a product that is
 * assessed. The factor can be further defined by characterizing an entity, but
 * it does not have to define an entity.
 * <br>
 * The terms attribute and property are used interchangeably in the literature.
 * Here, we chose the term factor to clearly distinguish it from the term
 * quality attribute defined in ISO 9126 [ISO9126].
 * <br>
 * General Rules:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Use a factor to define a property of an entity entity in a textual
 * descriptive way.
 * <li>Provide textual criteria in the factor's description that defines when an
 * entity exhibits the property and when not.</li>
 * <li>Create a factor before you think about the measures that quantify it.
 * This is
 * helpful to ensure that you measure what you really want to measure.
 * Furthermore, it helps to create factors at the right level of abstraction,
 * preventing the quantitative explosion of factors and impacts.</li>
 * <li>There are different types of factors:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Product Factors</li>
 * <li>Product Quality Attribute (ISO 25010)</li>
 * <li>Quality in Use Attribute (ISO 25010)</li>
 * <li>Stakeholder Satisfaction</li>
 * <li>Technical Issue</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
